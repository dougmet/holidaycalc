# Holiday Calculator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dougmet/holidaycalc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dougmet/holidaycalc)

This is a proof of concept for running R-based web APIs from plumber. There are two main components to the project:

1. R package: Containing package code and separate api endpoints (in inst directory).
2. `Dockerfile`: An image, based on the [plumber](https://github.com/dougmet/docker-plumber) image that installs the package and starts the plumber process.

An example of a website using the API is at: [dougashton.net/holidaycalc](http://www.dougashton.net/holidaycalc/). For now the API isn't well documented.

There's a simple GET endpoint that I use to test it's working at https://api.dougashton.net/pb/hols/now
